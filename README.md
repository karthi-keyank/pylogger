# Keylogger with Client-Server Architecture

This project implements a **keylogger** with a **client-server architecture**. The **server** listens for key presses on the host machine and sends the recorded keystrokes to the **client**, which logs them into a file. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is intended **strictly for educational and ethical purposes**. Unauthorized keylogging is **illegal** and may violate privacy laws. **Use this project only on machines you own or have explicit permission to monitor.** The author is not responsible for any misuse.

## üìå Features

- **Remote Key Logging** ‚Äì Captures keystrokes on the **server** and sends them to the **client**.
- **Persistent Connection** ‚Äì Reconnects automatically when the client disconnects.
- **Logs with Timestamp** ‚Äì The client appends a timestamp every 12 seconds for reference.
- **Background Logging** ‚Äì Uses **APScheduler** to log time without interrupting key capture.
- **Handles Special Keys** ‚Äì Maps keys like **Enter, Backspace, Shift, Ctrl**, etc.

## üìú How It Works

### üñ•Ô∏è **Server (Keylogger)**
1. Listens for a client connection.
2. Captures **keystrokes** using `pynput`.
3. Sends keystrokes to the connected client.
4. If the client disconnects, it waits for reconnection.

### üì° **Client (Logger)**
1. Connects to the server.
2. Continuously **receives keystrokes** and writes them to a file (`keylogs.txt`).
3. Uses `APScheduler` to log the current **timestamp** every 12 seconds.
4. Closes the connection gracefully on exit.
